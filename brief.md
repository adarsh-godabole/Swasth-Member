# Swasth Member App — build brief

Feed this whole file to a fresh Claude Code session started in the member app
folder. It assumes no knowledge of the backend.

---

## 1. What you are building

The **member-facing mobile app** for a single gym, on Android and iOS. It talks
to an existing, deployed REST API. **You are not building the backend and cannot
change it** — if something seems missing, say so rather than inventing an
endpoint. Several things genuinely are missing; section 8 lists them.

### Decided already — don't re-litigate

| Decision      | Choice                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework     | **Expo** (managed workflow), TypeScript             |
| Navigation    | Expo Router                                         |
| Server state  | TanStack Query                                      |
| Token storage | `expo-secure-store` — **not** AsyncStorage          |
| Auth          | Phone + OTP. No passwords, no social login          |
| Repo          | Standalone (separate from the backend and the portal) |
| Payments      | **None in the app.** Members pay cash at the desk   |

Nothing exists yet. Scaffold from scratch.

### Be honest about the scope

Today a member can: **log in, complete onboarding, see their membership status,
browse the price list, and edit their profile.** That's it.

They cannot check in, book a class, see a workout, track progress, or buy
anything — none of that exists in the backend yet. Build a genuinely good
version of the small thing, and leave obvious room for the rest. Do not stub out
fake screens for features that have no data behind them.

---

## 2. Backend

| Environment | Base URL                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Deployed    | `https://swasth-be.onrender.com/api/v1`   |
| Swagger     | `https://swasth-be.onrender.com/api/docs` |

> **The backend sleeps.** It is on a free tier: after 15 minutes idle, the next
> request takes **30–60 seconds**. This is the single biggest UX hazard for a
> mobile app, where a spinner that long reads as "broken". Do not set short
> timeouts. Show a "waking up the gym's server…" message after ~5 seconds, and
> consider firing a cheap `GET /gyms/current` on app launch to warm it while the
> user is still reading the welcome screen.

### Two headers on every request

```
X-Gym-Code: swasth-koramangala      <- required on essentially everything
Authorization: Bearer <accessToken> <- required except on the login endpoints
```

The backend serves **many gyms from one database**. Each gym gets **its own app
build** with its code baked in — the member never types or picks a gym. Put it
in `app.config.ts` as `extra.gymCode` (or `EXPO_PUBLIC_GYM_CODE`) so building
for a second gym is a config change, not a code change. Never hardcode it in a
screen.

A token is minted for one gym; the server rejects a mismatch with `403`.

### Response envelope

Success: `{ "success": true, "data": { ... } }`

Error:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 401,
  "message": "Incorrect OTP. 4 attempt(s) remaining.",
  "errors": ["optional per-field validation messages"],
  "path": "/api/v1/auth/otp/verify",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-14T06:31:18.389Z"
}
```

Unwrap `data` in the API client so screens never see the envelope. **Show
`message` to the user as-is** — the backend's messages are written for humans and
are usually better than anything generic you'd substitute.

---

## 3. Auth

### Flow

1. `POST /auth/otp/send` → `{ phone }`
2. `POST /auth/otp/verify` → `{ phone, code, platform, appVersion }` → tokens
3. Store tokens. Attach the access token to every request.
4. On `401`, refresh once via `POST /auth/refresh`, then retry.

**Token storage on mobile:** keep the **refresh token in `expo-secure-store`**
(Keychain / Keystore). The access token can live in memory and be re-derived by
refreshing on cold start — it only lasts 15 minutes anyway. Never put either in
AsyncStorage; it is unencrypted.

Refresh tokens last **30 days and rotate on every use** — always store both
tokens from the refresh response. Reusing a rotated token makes the backend kill
the entire session as suspected theft, so **queue concurrent 401s behind a single
refresh**. On mobile this matters more than on web: several screens refetch at
once when the app returns from background.

### `POST /auth/otp/send`

Headers: `X-Gym-Code`. No auth. Body `{ "phone": "9876543210" }` — local Indian
format or E.164 both work.

```json
{ "phone": "+91XXXXXX3210", "expiresAt": "…", "devCode": "123456" }
```

`devCode` is present only while the backend runs in staging. Use it to log in
during development; never show it in a production build.

> **60-second resend cooldown per number.** Asking again too soon returns a
> `400` and the *original* code stays valid. Your resend button must be disabled
> with a visible countdown. This has repeatedly tripped us up in testing.

OTP expires in **5 minutes**, allows **5 wrong attempts**.

### `POST /auth/otp/verify`

Headers: `X-Gym-Code`. No auth.

```json
{
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "code": "123456",
  "platform": "ANDROID",
  "appVersion": "1.0.0",
  "pushToken": "optional FCM/APNs token"
}
```

Send `platform` (`ANDROID` | `IOS`) — it registers the device, which is what
push notifications will hang off later. `pushToken` is optional; wire it once you
add notifications.

Response:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "…", "refreshToken": "…", "expiresIn": 900,
  "isNewUser": false,
  "user": {
    "id": "…", "phone": "+919876543210", "fullName": "Rohit Sharma",
    "role": "MEMBER", "memberCode": "SWK-0001", "onboarded": false
  },
  "gym": { "id": "…", "code": "swasth-koramangala", "name": "Swasth Fitness, Koramangala" }
}
```

**Route on `onboarded`, not `isNewUser`.** Someone the front desk registered
months ago is not a new user, but has never completed in-app onboarding.
`isNewUser` only tells you whether the account was created just now.

**If `role` is not `MEMBER`** (a trainer or admin logged in), the app still
works — they simply have no membership. Don't crash; just don't show them a
membership card.

### Other auth routes

- `POST /auth/refresh` — `{ refreshToken }` → new pair. No gym header needed.
- `POST /auth/logout` — `{ refreshToken }` → `204`. Clear local tokens
  regardless of the response.

### Test login

Gym `swasth-koramangala`, OTP `123456`:

| Phone        | Who                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `9876543210` | Rohit Sharma — a real member with an active membership |
| `9845012345` | Priya Nair — membership expiring today                 |

Any unused number logs in as a brand-new visitor with no membership — useful for
testing the empty state.

---

## 4. What a member can call

This is the **complete** list. Everything else returns `403`.

```
GET    /gyms/current                 gym profile (no auth needed)
GET    /users/me                     profile + membership
PATCH  /users/me                     edit profile
POST   /users/me/onboarding/complete mark onboarding done
DELETE /users/me                     delete account
GET    /plans                        the price list
POST   /auth/*                       as above
```

### `GET /users/me` — the most important call

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "phone": "+919876543210",
  "fullName": "Rohit Sharma",
  "email": null,
  "emailVerified": false,
  "gender": "MALE",
  "dateOfBirth": "1995-04-17T00:00:00.000Z",
  "heightCm": 175.5,
  "weightKg": 82.4,
  "avatarUrl": null,
  "city": null,

  "membership": {
    "gymId": "…",
    "role": "MEMBER",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "memberCode": "SWK-0001",
    "goal": "WEIGHT_LOSS",
    "activityLevel": "BEGINNER",
    "medicalNotes": "Left knee surgery 2023",
    "emergencyContactName": "Sunita Sharma",
    "emergencyContactPhone": "+919812345678",
    "onboarded": true,
    "joinedAt": "…",
    "lastVisitAt": null
  },

  "subscription": {
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "subscriptionId": "…",
    "planName": "3 Months",
    "startDate": "2026-08-14T00:00:00.000Z",
    "endDate": "2026-11-13T00:00:00.000Z",
    "daysRemaining": 91,
    "balance": 0,
    "coveredUntil": "2026-12-13T00:00:00.000Z",
    "hasRenewalQueued": true
  }
}
```

> **The two words mean different things, and the naming is admittedly
> confusing.** `membership` is their *relationship with the gym* — member code,
> role, goal, emergency contact. `subscription` is the *plan they have paid for*.
> A person can have a `membership` and no `subscription`: that's someone who
> installed the app but never bought anything.

**`subscription` is `null` for anyone who has never bought a plan.** That is a
completely normal state, not an error, and it is what every brand-new app signup
looks like. Design that home screen deliberately — it should explain how to join
and point them at the price list and the gym's phone number, because **they
cannot buy in the app.**

`subscription.status` values and what the home screen should say:

| Status      | Meaning                              | Suggested treatment                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `null`      | Never bought a plan                  | "Visit the gym to join" + price list      |
| `ACTIVE`    | Paid up and running                  | Plan name, big days-remaining number      |
| `UPCOMING`  | Paid, starts in the future           | "Starts on 15 Sep"                        |
| `EXPIRED`   | Lapsed                               | Prominent "renew at the desk" prompt      |
| `CANCELLED` | Cancelled by the gym                 | Same as expired, softer wording           |

Two subtleties:

- `daysRemaining` is **0 on the last valid day** (say "expires today") and goes
  **negative** once past. Don't render "-3 days left".
- When `hasRenewalQueued` is true, `endDate` is the current term's end but
  `coveredUntil` is the real answer to "how long am I covered". Show
  `coveredUntil` and mention the renewal, or the member will think they're
  about to expire when they've already paid.
- `balance` greater than 0 means they still owe the gym money. Worth surfacing
  quietly — "₹2,000 due at the desk" — not as an error.

### `PATCH /users/me` — profile and onboarding answers

All fields optional. Person-level: `fullName`, `email`, `gender`, `dateOfBirth`
(`YYYY-MM-DD`), `heightCm`, `weightKg`, `city`, `avatarUrl`. Gym-level:
`goal`, `activityLevel`, `medicalNotes`, `emergencyContactName`,
`emergencyContactPhone`.

**PATCH semantics:**

| You send         | Result                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| field omitted    | left alone                             |
| `"field": null`  | **cleared**                            |
| `"field": ""`    | `400` on validated fields — use `null` |

`gender: null` resets to `UNDISCLOSED` (it is never null in responses).

Validation: `fullName` 2–120, `email` a valid address, `heightCm` 50–280,
`weightKg` 20–500, `medicalNotes` ≤1000, `city` ≤100. Mirror these in the form
or the API will reject it. **Unknown fields are rejected with a `400`** — send
only what is listed.

### `POST /users/me/onboarding/complete`

No body. Call it once the member finishes the onboarding questions; it flips
`membership.onboarded` to true so you know not to show onboarding again. It is
idempotent.

### `GET /plans` — the price list

Members see only active, public plans, cheapest sort order first.

```json
[
  { "id": "…", "name": "Day Pass", "description": null,
    "durationValue": 1, "durationUnit": "DAY", "durationLabel": "1 day",
    "price": 300, "isActive": true, "isPublic": true, "sortOrder": 0,
    "archivedAt": null }
]
```

`durationLabel` is pre-formatted ("3 months") — use it rather than composing
your own. `price` is in **rupees** as a number. **There is no way to buy from the
app** — this is a price list. Pair it with a call button to the gym.

### `GET /gyms/current`

No auth, so it works on the login screen. Returns `name`, `phone`, address
parts, `city`, `logoUrl`, `timezone`, `currency`. Use it for branding on the
welcome screen, and for a "Call the gym" / "Directions" action.

### `DELETE /users/me`

Soft-deletes the account across all gyms and returns `204`. **Both app stores
require an in-app account deletion path**, so build it into Profile with a clear
confirmation.

---

## 5. Nullability

Almost everything is nullable. `fullName` especially — members registered at the
desk have one, but anyone who signed up in the app has **`null`** until they
complete onboarding.

Non-null guarantees: `id`, `phone`, `gender`, `membership.role`,
`membership.status`, `membership.memberCode` (only for desk-registered members —
**null for app signups**), `membership.onboarded`, `membership.joinedAt`.

Everything else — `fullName`, `email`, `dateOfBirth`, `heightCm`, `weightKg`,
`city`, `avatarUrl`, `goal`, `activityLevel`, `medicalNotes`, both emergency
contact fields, `lastVisitAt`, and the whole `subscription` object — can be null.
Render fallbacks; never show "undefined" or crash a screen.

---

## 6. Enums

```ts
type Gender = 'MALE' | 'FEMALE' | 'OTHER' | 'UNDISCLOSED';
type FitnessGoal = 'WEIGHT_LOSS' | 'MUSCLE_GAIN' | 'GENERAL_FITNESS' | 'ENDURANCE' | 'REHAB';
type ActivityLevel = 'BEGINNER' | 'OCCASIONAL' | 'REGULAR';
type GymRole = 'MEMBER' | 'TRAINER' | 'GYM_ADMIN' | 'OWNER';
type DurationUnit = 'DAY' | 'MONTH';
type SubscriptionStatus = 'ACTIVE' | 'UPCOMING' | 'EXPIRED' | 'CANCELLED';
type DevicePlatform = 'ANDROID' | 'IOS';
```

Show friendly labels ("Lose weight", not `WEIGHT_LOSS`) but send the exact
strings.

---

## 7. What to build

In this order; each step should run on a real device before the next.

### 1. Scaffold
Expo + TypeScript + Expo Router + TanStack Query + `expo-secure-store`. Gym code
in `app.config.ts`. A typed API client that attaches both headers, unwraps the
envelope, throws errors carrying `message`/`statusCode`/`errors`, and handles
single-flight refresh on 401.

### 2. Auth
Welcome screen (gym name and logo from `GET /gyms/current`), phone entry, OTP
entry with **auto-advancing boxes and a resend countdown**, secure token
storage, and silent restore on cold start so a returning member never sees the
login screen. Route on `membership.onboarded`.

### 3. Onboarding
The questions from `PATCH /users/me`: name, gender, date of birth, height,
weight, goal, activity level, medical notes, emergency contact. Skippable, a few
per screen rather than one long form. Finish with
`POST /users/me/onboarding/complete`.

### 4. Home
The membership card is the whole screen: plan name, days remaining as the hero
number, expiry date, and the renewal note when `hasRenewalQueued`. Handle all
five states from the table above — **the `null` state deserves as much care as
the happy path**, since every new signup starts there. Add the gym's phone
number and address.

### 5. Plans
The price list, with a "call the gym to join" action. Make it clear this is
information, not a checkout.

### 6. Profile
View and edit everything, member code shown prominently (the desk asks for it),
logout, and account deletion.

### Quality bar
- Works on a slow, sleeping backend: real loading states, retry, offline notice.
- Every screen has loading, empty and error states.
- Test on a real Android device, not just the simulator.
- Never show a raw enum, a null, or a stack trace to a member.

---

## 8. What does not exist — do not invent it

The backend has **no endpoints** for any of this. If a screen needs it, stop and
say so:

1. **Check-in / QR / attendance.** No check-in exists. `lastVisitAt` is always
   null — nothing sets it yet. This is the next backend feature.
2. **Classes, schedules, bookings.** None.
3. **Trainers, workout plans, progress tracking, body measurements.** None.
4. **Buying a plan in the app.** Deliberately absent — members pay cash at the
   desk. There is no payment gateway and none is planned for now.
5. **Membership history.** A member can see their *current* membership via
   `GET /users/me`, but there is **no endpoint for their past memberships or
   payment receipts** — `/members/:id/subscriptions` is staff-only and returns
   `403` for a member. If you want a billing history screen, ask for
   `GET /users/me/subscriptions` to be added rather than working around it.
6. **Push notifications.** The device is registered at login, but nothing sends
   anything yet.
7. **Freeze / pause membership.** Not built.

Also note: **the 60-second OTP cooldown** and **30–60 second cold starts** are
the two things most likely to make a working app feel broken.

---

## 9. Working agreement

- **Verify on a real device.** Run it against the deployed backend with the test
  logins above. Don't call a screen done without seeing it with real data.
- **Don't mock the API.** It's live; use it.
- **If an endpoint you need doesn't exist, stop and say so.** Don't invent one
  and don't fake the data — the backend is a separate repo, changed
  deliberately.
- Keep API types in one place, mirroring sections 4–6 exactly.
